# Rstudiotheme

Made with tmTheme Editor

## Windows

To add this theme in the Rstudio list of themes you need to put the file in this directory (assuming the default installation path of Rstudio) `C:\Program Files\RStudio\resources\themes`

## Linux

To add this theme in your Rstudio list of themes you need to put the file in this directory (this is from a Manjaro computer that installed Rstudio from the AUR so maybe with some other distros such as Fedora or Debian/Ubuntu derivatives the path may be different) `/usr/lib64/rstudio/resources/themes/`

Notice that you'll need superuser privileges to add or modify in this directory, so I recommend running `cd /usr/lib64/rstudio/resources/themes/` and `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enrique95/Rstudiotheme/master/synthwave.tmTheme` in the terminal
